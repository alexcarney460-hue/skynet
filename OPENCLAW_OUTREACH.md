### Subject Line
```
Partnership: Skynet Cognitive Infrastructure Integration Test
```

### Body

```
Hi OpenClaw Team,

I've built Skynet, an open-source cognitive infrastructure system for 
autonomous agents. It gives agents self-awareness under resource constraints 
using deterministic heuristics (no ML, no black boxes).

**What Skynet Does:**
- Context Pressure Regulator: Evaluates session survivability + token risk
- Verbosity Drift Suppressor: Detects + corrects output inflation
- Session Half-Life Estimator: Predicts stability decay
- Drift Detection Layer: Real-time system health monitoring

**Claimed ROI:**
- 30-50% token savings per response
- 80%+ failure prevention
- <50ms latency overhead per gate

**The Situation:**
These are currently theoretical metrics. I have working APIs and 
production-safe middleware, but ZERO real-world agent data to validate 
the claims.

**What I'm Proposing:**
Co-test Skynet with OpenClaw agents over 4 weeks.

- Run 5 diverse OpenClaw agents (research, planning, coding, chat, autonomy)
- Baseline: 10 heavy sessions per agent (2-4 hours each, no Skynet)
- With Skynet: 10 identical sessions per agent (with Skynet middleware)
- Measure: token savings, session stability, error prevention, latency
- Share: Complete metrics + case study + integration learnings

**Why This Wins for OpenClaw:**
- Validate cognitive infrastructure integration path
- Get real production data on agent improvements
- Influence early-stage product roadmap
- Public case study (if metrics green)

**Why This Wins for Me:**
- Prove/disprove ROI claims with real agents
- Only launch publicly if metrics validate
- De-risk Phase 3 (monetization)
- High-credibility partnership announcement

**Current Status:**
- APIs live: https://skynet-gray.vercel.app/api/v1/*
- Middleware designed: OPENCLAW_MIDDLEWARE.md (ready to insert)
- Test protocol defined: PHASE_2_METRICS_PROTOCOL.md
- All code open-source (GitHub)

**Timeline:**
- Week 1: Alignment + hook insertion
- Weeks 2-3: Heavy agent testing (4 runs per agent)
- Week 4: Metrics analysis + case study

**No Cost to OpenClaw.** I own the API infrastructure. You contribute 
agent time + access.

Interested in discussing? Happy to jump on a call or provide more details.

## Discord Message (If You Join)

Post in #general or relevant channel:

```
Hey all, I built Skynet — open-source cognitive infrastructure for agents. 
Four heuristics that give agents self-awareness: pressure regulation, 
verbosity suppression, half-life estimation, drift detection.

Claimed ROI: 30-50% token savings + 80%+ failure prevention.

Currently looking to validate these claims with real OpenClaw agents 
(4-week co-test). Anyone know who handles partnerships?

Happy to chat!

## Checklist

- [ ] Send email to `[email protected]` (this week)
- [ ] Join Discord + post in #general (today)
- [ ] Follow up email if no response after 5 business days
- [ ] Prepare for call (have metrics protocol + middleware ready)
- [ ] Await response (24-48 hours typical)

---

## Success Looks Like

**Best case**: OpenClaw agrees to co-test, sponsors 5 agents, you run Phase 2 for free.

**Good case**: OpenClaw interested but wants to discuss terms/timeline.

**Okay case**: OpenClaw passes but gives you feedback / intro to someone else.

**Action if rejected**: Run on AWS ($100-150), move forward independently.

## After They Respond

**If Yes**: Schedule call to discuss:
- Hook insertion points (where do you want gates?)
- Metric capture (logging + rollup)
- Test timeline + agent selection
- Data sharing + public case study rights

**If Interested but Hesitant**: Address concerns:
- "Will this break our agents?" → Show middleware failure-safe logic
- "What's the overhead?" → Show latency targets (<50ms p99)
- "How do we measure?" → Show PHASE_2_METRICS_PROTOCOL.md

**If No**: Move to AWS option. Smaller test, still validates hypothesis.

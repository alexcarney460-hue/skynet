# SKYNET — Complete Strategy Document

**Agent Cognitive Infrastructure for OpenClaw**

---

## Executive Summary

Skynet is **heuristic-driven cognitive infrastructure** that gives agents self-awareness under resource constraints.

Not ML. Not dashboards. Not marketplaces.

**Core value**: Agents make intelligent decisions (compress, optimize, checkpoint, terminate) with no human intervention.

**Revenue**: Free tier drives adoption, Builder tier captures value, Infrastructure tier scales.

**Growth**: Viral-worthy demos create organic reach; network effects amplify adoption.

---

## The Architecture

### Four Core Heuristic Models

```
1. Context Pressure Regulator
   └─ "Is this safe to continue?"
   └─ States: LOW → MODERATE → HIGH → CRITICAL
   └─ Prevents: Token budget overrun
   └─ ROI: 20-30% token savings

2. Verbosity Drift Suppressor
   └─ "Am I wasting tokens?"
   └─ States: OPTIMAL → DRIFTING → EXCESSIVE
   └─ Prevents: Output bloat
   └─ ROI: 10-20% token savings

3. Session Half-Life Estimator
   └─ "How much time left?"
   └─ States: STABLE → DECAYING → FRAGILE
   └─ Enables: Proactive checkpointing
   └─ ROI: 15-30% uptime improvement

4. Drift Probability Meta-Layer
   └─ "What's the overall risk?"
   └─ Combines: Pressure + Verbosity + Half-Life
   └─ Provides: Confidence + explanation
   └─ ROI: Explainable decisions
```

**Combined ROI**: 30-50% token savings + 80%+ failure prevention

### How Agents Use It

```
Agent Decision Loop:
├─ Before responding: Check VERBOSITY
│  └─ If EXCESSIVE: truncate output
├─ Before expensive op: Check PRESSURE
│  └─ If HIGH: compress memory
├─ Before memory write: Check HALF-LIFE
│  └─ If FRAGILE: save checkpoint
└─ Strategic decision: Check DRIFT PROBABILITY
   └─ If ELEVATED: prepare intervention
```

**Latency**: <5ms per decision (negligible)

### Defensibility
- Heuristic IP: Proprietary decay models
- First-mover advantage in agent cognition

## The Bet

**If agents get cognitive self-awareness**, they become:
- More reliable (fewer crashes)

# Monetization Surfaces — Clean Value Alignment

**Never charge for access. Charge for capability intensity.**

---

## Monetization Principle

Users pay based on:
- How much they use Skynet
- How advanced the heuristics are
- How valuable the cost savings are

**NOT** based on:
- Access restrictions
- Artificial paywalls
- Locked core functionality

---

## Three-Tier Model

### Tier 1: Free (Always Free)

**For**: Solo developers, hobbyists, small agents

**Includes**:
- ✅ Basic heuristics (Pressure, Verbosity, Half-Life)
- ✅ Public API (`https://skynetx.io/api/v1/*`)
- ✅ Unlimited calls (fair use)
- ✅ Full specification + documentation
- ✅ CLI tool
- ✅ Open source (MIT)

**Restrictions**: None (optional rate limits for abuse prevention)

**Cost**: Free  
**User satisfaction**: Very high (full product access)

**Example**:
```
Developer integrates Skynet into personal OpenClaw agent
Uses all four heuristics
No payment, no friction
```

---

### Tier 2: Builder ($29/month)

**For**: Team builders, active development, multiple agents

**Includes** (everything in Free +):
- ✅ Advanced heuristic tuning (domain-specific profiles)
- ✅ Higher rate limits (1000 calls/min vs 100)
- ✅ Priority API responses
- ✅ Custom heuristic weights (for specialized agents)
- ✅ Historical data export (trends over 30 days)
- ✅ Email support
- ✅ Integration examples (LangChain, etc.)
- ✅ Early access to new heuristics
- ✅ Prometheus metrics export

**Why attractive**:
- Developers get measurable cost savings (10-30% token reduction)
- ROI easily justifies $29/month
- No friction to upgrade

**Example**:
```
Team running 5 agents across projects
Sees 15% token savings = $100+/month savings
Pays $29/month for Skynet
3.4x ROI immediately visible
```

---

### Tier 3: Infrastructure ($0.10 per 1M calls)

**For**: Heavy automation, agent fleets, production pipelines

**Includes** (everything in Builder +):
- ✅ Usage-based pricing (pay for what you use)
- ✅ Advanced compute heuristics (optimization engines)
- ✅ Custom integration support
- ✅ SLA (99.9% uptime)
- ✅ Dedicated support channel
- ✅ Bulk discounts (volume pricing)
- ✅ Webhook alerts (critical states)
- ✅ Fleet monitoring dashboard
- ✅ Custom cognitive models (future)

**Pricing**:
- Base: $99/month (includes 1B calls)
- Overage: $0.10 per 1M calls

**Why attractive**:
- Large operations pay based on actual usage
- No fixed cost surprises
- Transparent, scalable pricing
- Cost naturally aligns with savings

**Example**:
```
Large SaaS company running 1000 agents
Each agent saves 20% tokens
Total annual savings: $50,000+
Pays Infrastructure tier: ~$2,000/year
25x ROI
```

## Revenue Model

### Free Tier
- Acquisition cost: $0
- Lifetime value: $0 (but seeds ecosystem)
- Purpose: Market penetration, network effects

### Builder Tier
- Acquisition cost: Low (self-service)
- Monthly revenue: $29
- Expected conversion: 5-10% of free users
- Lifetime value: $500+ (typical 18-month retention)

### Infrastructure Tier
- Acquisition cost: Medium (enterprise sales)
- Monthly revenue: $500-$5000+ (usage-dependent)
- Expected conversion: 1-5% of Builder users
- Lifetime value: $10,000+ (sticky, high-value)

---

## Natural Upgrade Path

```
Developer tries free tier
├─ "This is amazing and free"
├─ Integrates across projects
├─ Sees 15% token savings
└─ Hits rate limits or wants advanced tuning
   └─ Upgrades to Builder ($29/month)
      ├─ Gets domain-specific profiles
      ├─ Higher limits
      └─ Historical trending
         ├─ Uses across team (5 agents)
         ├─ Saves $50+/month in tokens
         └─ ROI is obvious
            └─ Considers Enterprise for fleet ops
               └─ Scales to Infrastructure tier
```

## Non-Invasive Monetization Strategy

### What We DON'T Do
❌ Limit core heuristics to paid tiers  
❌ Artificial rate limiting on free tier  
❌ Paywalling documentation  
❌ Crippling free version  
❌ Aggressive upselling  

### What We DO
✅ Offer convenience features (tuning, exports, support)  
✅ Enable advanced use cases (fleets, optimization)  
✅ Provide transparent ROI calculation  
✅ Fair usage-based pricing  
✅ Let value speak for itself
